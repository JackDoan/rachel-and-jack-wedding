Jack is still making the website. Don't worry, everything about the wedding will be on this website Soon(tm). You can even bookmark it if you want.

### When is the wedding?
April 2nd, 2022


### Hotel, transportation, and parking
Hotel TBA-- we’re trying to see if we can get a shuttle service set up for our guests. If you don’t want to wait to book, there are multiple hotels within a mile of the venue. 

If you know for sure you’re driving, parking is best at either the Downtown Plano DART station or the outside lot at McCall Plaza. 


### Gifts and registry
First of all, please don’t get us anything. We’ve been living together for 2.5 years and already own too many things. What we would appreciate most is you writing us a thoughtful card.

That being said, we know some of you will still want to give us gifts no matter what we say, so here’s [the registry](https://registry.theknot.com/jack-doan-april-2022-tx/50042705)


### Dress code
The dress code is somewhere between “dressy casual” and “semi-formal” but no one knows what that means so:
- Suit and tie not necessary, but nicer than jeans
- Fancier than a first date but less fancy than prom 
- Something you could comfortably stand in for cocktail hour 


We’re looking forward to seeing you there!
